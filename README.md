### 💡 App Purpose

**Insta Flow** is a desktop-based image sorting and preview application designed for fast, keyboard-driven image triage workflows.  
The application enables users to preview images in large format, maintain visual context of surrounding images, and efficiently copy or move files into predefined or custom folders using simple keyboard shortcuts.

The tool is ideal for photographers, content creators, and anyone managing large image datasets who needs speed, clarity, and safety when organizing files.

🧠 How It Works

- The user selects a folder containing images.
- All supported image files are loaded and displayed:
  - One image in a **large primary preview window**
  - Five images in a **secondary preview strip** (two previous, current, two next)
- The user navigates images using:
  - **Left Arrow** → Previous image
  - **Right Arrow** → Next image
- Images are sorted using number keys:
  - **1 / 2 / 3** → Copy or move the currently previewed image to the corresponding folder
- Folder behavior:
  - Default folders: folder 1, folder 2, folder 3
  - Optional custom folder names can be enabled per folder
- Sorting modes:
  - **COPY mode**: Original image remains untouched
  - **MOVE mode**: Image is only deleted after a successful move

All file operations are handled safely to prevent data loss.
